## Contributing Guidelines
Hi! Thanks for taking the time to contribute to this open-source project. These guidelines will help make your time spent contributing as effective as possible.

## Understanding this Project
Before contributing, I highly recommend you take the time to understand what this project does, and how this project works. Read `README.md`, download the code, play around with it. Take some time to read `writeup.pdf` -- you can skim some sections, but it's good to build a familiarity with how this project was created, and how it is intended to function.

## Issues
We manage what work needs to be done in the Issues section of the GitHub page. Please see that page to understand what work would be most beneficial. If you notice something that might need improvements of fixing, your first step should be to add an issue. Please make sure the issue does not exist first though! When you're ready to tackle an issue, please assign it to yourself, to avoid duplicate work.

We have a unique label for certain issues called `see write up`. This means this is an original issue from the project's `writeup.pdf`'s Future Work section. This shouldn't be added to new issues, but if you see it on an old issue, it may be helpful to revisit `writeup.pdf`.

## Adding Code
As you are coding, we ask that you work on your own branch in order to keep a neat work history. The naming convention for these branches is `user/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/YOUR-ISSUE-HERE`, replacing with your username, and the name of the number assigned to the issue you are tackling. When you're finished, please create a pull request and request a review from `maxmmitchell` (me). I should get notifications from that, but if I don't respond in a timely fashion, please message me on GitHub or email me. I'll review it and give comments, you'll address any needed changes, and eventually it will be SQUASH merged. We always squash merge PRs.

## Getting Help
If you're having difficulty at any point, please add a comment in the issue explaining the situation, or reach out to me via GitHub or email.
